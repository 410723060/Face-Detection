# Face Detection
 Face recognition with OpenCV, Python, and deep learning
 
* Class 1. Face recognition
    * Face Detection using Haar Cascades. First we need to load the required XML classifiers. Then load our input image (or video) in grayscale mode.
    * Now we find the faces in the image. If faces are found, it returns the positions of detected faces as Rect(x,y,w,h). 
    * Once we get these locations, we can create a ROI for the face.
* Class 2. Save Face/Frame
* Class 3. Training model
    * Single-channel: Gray Level Image
    * Triple-channel: Color Image
